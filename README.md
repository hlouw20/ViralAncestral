# Viral Ancestral
Infer a phylogenetic tree from viral sequences, and use the tree to estimate the ancestral protein sequence of this group.

## To do 
- Reach out to George Tiley regarding Perl help 
- Install + trim with HmmCleaner (I think the AA sequences are already trimmed via MACSE with HmmCleaner?)
- Separate YX-AUG regions for 5'UTR region in IRES types 1, 2, 3
- Align separated YX-AUG regions with MACSE and MUSCLE
- Read paper about Taxon Specificity 
- Read paper about Non-Time Reversibility
