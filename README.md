# Viral Ancestral
Infer a phylogenetic tree from viral sequences, and use the tree to estimate the ancestral protein sequence of this group.

## To do 
- Find Successful Data for ASR (ask Helena)
- Watch tuturial on how to use GenBank
- Read paper on LG Substitution Matrix (preferred by IQ-Tree for the AA sequences that had larger datasets)
- Use IQ-Tree for ASR
  1. Replicase Tree with 5'UTR NT (IRES 1, 2, 3)
  2. 5'UTR Tree with 5'UTR NT (IRES 1, 2, 3)
- Separate YX-AUG regions for 5'UTR region in IRES types 1, 2, 3
- Align separated YX-AUG regions with MACSE and MUSCLE
- Read paper about Taxon Specificity 
- Read paper about Non-Time Reversibility
