# Viral Ancestral
Infer a phylogenetic tree from viral sequences, and use the tree to estimate the ancestral protein sequence of this group.

## To do 
- Figure out how to increase substitution cost for Replicase gene and run through MACSE
- Run Replicase gene with higher substitution cost through trimAL
- Download T-COFFEE for Mac
- Run Replicase Gene through T-COFFEE
- Manually align YX-AUG regions separately (IRES types 1,2,3) with Helena
