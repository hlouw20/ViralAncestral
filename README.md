# Viral Ancestral
Infer a phylogenetic tree from viral sequences, and use the tree to estimate the ancestral protein sequence of this group.

## To do 
- Read paper on LG Substitution Matrix (preferred by IQ-Tree for the AA sequences that had larger datasets)
- Use FastML for ASR, making sure to include email for results
- Separate YX-AUG regions for 5'UTR region in IRES types 1, 2, 3
- Align separated YX-AUG regions with MACSE and MUSCLE
- Read paper about Taxon Specificity 
- Read paper about Non-Time Reversibility
